# 🛰️ Satellite Image to Map Generator

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on converting **satellite images** into **map-like representations** using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The goal is to automatically extract meaningful features (roads, buildings, vegetation, water bodies) from raw satellite imagery and generate maps that can be used for urban planning, navigation, and geographic analysis.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of satellite images (resizing, normalization, augmentation).  
- Deep learning model for feature extraction and classification.  
- Map generation from segmented satellite images.  
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, IoU (Intersection over Union), and visualization of predictions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.8+**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy, Pandas**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
